About this page

Hi and welcome to the first version of my portfolio page.

This page is created as a challenge in Free code Camp and has the following user stories:

    User Story 1: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
    User Story 2: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
    User Story 3: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
    User Story 3: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation..
